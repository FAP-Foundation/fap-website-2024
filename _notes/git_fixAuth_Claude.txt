Based on the changes we've made, the VS Code "Source Control" Sync button should now be authorized with GitHub and working correctly. Here's a summary of what we did to resolve the issue:

We confirmed that the correct SSH key (FAP-sshKey) for the FAP Foundation account exists in the ~/.ssh directory.
We added the FAP-sshKey to the SSH agent using the ssh-add command.
We updated the Git configuration (.git/config) to use the correct SSH Host entry (github-fap) for the FAP Foundation GitHub account.
We verified that Git can now fetch from the remote repository using the updated configuration.
To confirm that the issue is fully resolved, please follow these steps:

Close and reopen VS Code to ensure it picks up the new configuration.
Open the Source Control view in VS Code (usually the third icon in the left sidebar, or use Ctrl+Shift+G).
Look for the Sync button (usually a circular arrow icon) in the Source Control view.
Click the Sync button.
If the Sync operation completes without any authentication errors, then the issue has been successfully resolved. You should be able to push, pull, and sync your changes using VS Code's Source Control features now.

If you encounter any issues or the Sync button still doesn't work, please let me know, and we can further investigate the problem.
